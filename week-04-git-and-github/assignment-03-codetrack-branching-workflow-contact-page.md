# Assignment 3 — CodeTrack: Branching Workflow (Add & Verify a Contact Page)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will add a new Contact page to CodeTrack using a clean feature-branch workflow. You will keep each change in a separate commit, prove that your default branch remains unchanged before the merge, and validate the result after merging.

# Task 1 — Confirm Repository State and Default Branch

## Goal

Start from a clean default branch (`main` or `master`) and confirm the repository status.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of `git status` and `git branch` showing a clean status and the default branch checked out

# Task 2 — Create and Switch to a Feature Branch

## Goal

Create a branch named exactly `feature/contact-page` and switch to it.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Output of `git checkout -b feature/contact-page` and `git branch` showing `* feature/contact-page`

# Task 3 — Add contact.html on the Feature Branch

## Goal

Create `contact.html` with the provided content and commit it alone using the message `feat(contact): add Contact page`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Output of `ls` showing `contact.html`

# Task 4 — Add the Contact Link to index.html

Add the provided Contact Page link to `index.html` and commit it separately using the message `feat(nav): add Contact Page link`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Output of `git status` showing `index.html` as modified before staging

# Task 5 — Verify Isolation (Prove the Default Branch Is Unchanged)

## Goal

Switch back to the default branch and confirm that `contact.html` and the Contact Page link do not exist there yet.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Terminal showing the checkout and `ls` output, proving `contact.html` is absent

![git checkout master and ls showing contact.html is absent](screenshots/task5-checkout-ls.png)

# Task 6 — Merge the Feature Branch into the Default Branch

## Goal

Merge `feature/contact-page` into your default branch and confirm the Contact page works.

### Evidence

# Task 7 — Inspect History (Graph View)

## Goal

Display the repository history as a graph and locate both feature commits.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 14 — Full output of `git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all`

![Full graph log output showing both feature commits](screenshots/task7-log-graph.png)

# Task 8 — Optional Cleanup (Delete the Feature Branch)

## Goal

Delete the merged `feature/contact-page` branch to keep your branch list clean.

### Evidence
